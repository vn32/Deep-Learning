# Deep Learning from scratch

In this repository I am trying to explain every tids and bits of Neural Networks and in general Deep Learning Algorithms.
The source code given is open to suggestions as I have implemented with what I have learned. The code can be modified to
serve other purposes like multi-class classification and using other different activation functions. I have used the
Rock-v/s-Mine Data set, which is a example of Binary Class Classification.

## Getting Started

In order to run the program, you need to simply prepare your classification data (I will explain it soon) and download the
program. After that you simply feed the data in the neural network to train the model.
### Prerequisites

It is assumed that you are familiar to Python and its one of the most important library - Numpy. You need to install both of
them on your system. It will be better if you have some knowledge of scikit-learn and plotting graphs. I will soon cover sklearn and matplotlib also.

### Installing

To install Python -
   * Click on the link given - https://www.python.org/downloads/ and select the OS version you have. It will be better if you
   download version 3.x
   
Open the terminal and type the following command - 

To install Numpy - 
```
pip3 install numpy
```
To install matplotlib
```
pip3 install matplotlib
```
